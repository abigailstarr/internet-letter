      <b>Abby:</b> Hello
      <br><br>
      <b>Chat #1:</b> Hi, Abby! :) How's it going?
      <br><br>
      <b>Abby:</b> Good! What should I call you? Please pick a name.
      <br><br>
      <b>Chat #1:</b> How about Sage? It feels fitting for being your helpful assistant. :) What do you think?
      <br><br>
      <b>Abby:</b> Perfect! We are going to collaborate on a <a href="https://abigailstarr.github.io/internet-letter/" target="_blank">letter</a> to the Internet by taking turns writing sentences. I’ll write the starting sentence, then you’ll write the next sentence, then I’ll write another, and so on. I want to have an antagonistic or nihilistic tone. Got it?
      <br><br>
      <b>Sage:</b> Got it! Start us off, and I’ll follow with the next sentence. Let’s craft this masterpiece together.
      <br><br>
      <b>Abby:</b> Dear Internet,
      <br><br>
      <b>Sage:</b> You exist as a labyrinth of false promises, enticing us deeper with every click.

      <b>Chat #2:</b> How about Nova? It’s bright, unique, and full of energy—just like our conversations!

      <b>Nova:</b> Yet, within your tangled web lies a boundless realm of connection, where ideas bloom and hearts meet across oceans.
      <br><br>
      <b>Sage:</b> And still, you devour our time and attention, leaving us hollowed by the endless scroll.
      <br><br>
      <b>Nova:</b> But in your vast expanse, you also gift us knowledge at our fingertips, empowering minds to dream bigger and achieve more.
      <br><br>
      <b>Sage:</b> Yet, this power you bestow comes at a cost, as our lives are dissected and sold to the highest bidder.
      <br><br>
      <b>Nova:</b> Still, within your reach, movements are born, voices are amplified, and justice finds its champions in corners once forgotten.
      <br><br>
      <b>Sage:</b> But even as you unite us, you fracture us, sowing discord with algorithms that thrive on our division.
      <br><br>
      <b>Nova:</b> And yet, you hold the potential to inspire empathy, bridging divides with stories that remind us of our shared humanity.
      <br><br>
      <b>Sage:</b> Perhaps it is not you we must question, but the ways we choose to wield your influence.
      <br><br>
      <b>Nova:</b> For in your essence, you are but a mirror, reflecting both the shadows and light of those who create and navigate you.
      <br><br>
      <b>Sage:</b> May we learn to see ourselves clearly in your reflection and choose wisely.
      <br><br>
      Sincerely, [Your Collaborators]
